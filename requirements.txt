The desired end-state is a website that quizes the user on interview questions and can create answers based on a mongodb collection, vector search, and rag.

The main page should:
Have a header that allows the user to 
- Answer a question
- Add an experience
- Add a question

Answer a question page:
- Allows the user to select a random quesiton from the questions collection. The user can select from the total collection, or narrow down by category
- Allows the user to enter their own question
-- once there is a question it will deplay it and provide a "generate answer" button.
- the generate answer button will generate an answer from open ai, using the rag created through mongo's vector search on the expereinces collection
- the generated answers should be specific to what's in the experiences collection, not general answers. 
- Answers generated should include details and be in star format.

The Add an experience pages should:
- let the user add an experience to the expereinces collection
- reindex and embed the question so it can be used in future "generate an answer" uses

The Add a question page should:
- Add a question to the questions collection

Any errors will show the details so the user can understand why it failed.
