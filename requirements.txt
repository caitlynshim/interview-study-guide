The desired end-state is a website that quizes the user on interview questions and can create answers based on a mongodb collection, vector search, and rag.

The main page should:
Have a header that allows the user to 
- Answer a question
- Add an experience
- Add a question

Answer a question page:
- Allows the user to select a random quesiton from the questions collection. The user can select from the total collection, or narrow down by category
- Allows the user to enter their own question
-- once there is a question it will deplay it and provide a "generate answer" button.
- the generate answer button will generate an answer from open ai, using the rag created through mongo's vector search on the expereinces collection

Any errors will show the details so the user can understand why it failed.
