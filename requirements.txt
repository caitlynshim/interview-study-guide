# Interview-Prep Web App – Business Requirements Document

## 1. Vision
Deliver a modern, self-service web application that helps job-seekers practice behavioural and technical interview questions.  
The app must provide realistic prompts, personalised answers based on the user's past experiences, and structured feedback that improves both written and spoken responses.

---
## 2. Primary Personas
• **Candidate** – an experienced professional preparing for senior-level interviews. Uses the site to rehearse answers, capture experiences, and refine storytelling.  
• **Coach** (future persona) – reviews a candidate's answers and adds questions; not addressed in the current scope but considered for extensibility.

## 3. Navigation & Global Elements
| Element | Purpose | Success Criteria | Failure / Edge Cases |
|---------|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Sticky Navbar** (visible on all pages) | Allows users to jump between core tasks. Links: "Answer a question", "Add an experience", "Navigate experiences". | • Current page link is visually highlighted.  
• Links load target pages in <1 s. | • If navigation fails, an inline error banner "Unable to load page. Please refresh." appears without breaking other links. |

## 4. Workflows
### 4.1  Answer a Question
| Stage | Expected User Path | Outcome | Failure Handling |
|-------|--------------------|---------|------------------|
| 1. Select Prompt | a) Click "Random Question" to fetch one from the question bank.  
b) OR type/paste a custom question into the input field. | Question text appears in a dedicated card with category (if any). | • If the database returns no questions, show placeholder: "No questions found. Try adding some first."  
• Empty input disables subsequent actions. |
| 2. Generate Answer | Click "Generate Answer". | • Animated ellipsis shows progress.  
• A detailed, markdown answer appears, citing user experiences. | • API/server error displays: "Couldn't generate answer. Details: <error message>" and button is re-enabled. |
| 3. Review & Improve | Buttons: "Evaluate my answer", "Practice out loud", "Write my own answer". | Appropriate sub-flow opens (see below). | N/A |

#### 4.1.1  Write-In Answer & Evaluation
| Step | Desired Behaviour | Failure Handling |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| Enter answer in textarea → click "Evaluate". | • AI returns constructive scorecard (content depth, STAR completeness, executive tone).  
• Show modal with feedback and buttons: "Save as new experience", "Propose update to existing". | • If evaluation fails, banner: "Evaluation unavailable, please try later." Answer text is preserved. |
| System runs similarity check. | • If close match ≥ threshold, diff view (original vs. proposed) shown.  
• User chooses "Edit existing" → navigates to Navigate Experiences with edit form pre-populated. | • If no similar experience, user lands on Add Experience with fields prefilled. |

#### 4.1.2  Practice Out Loud
| Step | Desired Behaviour | Failure Handling |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| Click microphone icon to start/stop recording. | • Timer shows recording length.  
• On stop, audio uploads, transcripts, evaluates speech and content. | • Attempt to upload empty file shows toast: "Recording too short. Please try again."  
• Transcription error returns specific message; evaluation step skipped but transcript still shown. |

### 4.2  Add Experience
| Purpose | Form Fields | Success | Failure |
|---------|------------|---------|---------|
| Capture new STAR experience for future answers. | Title (required), Story (required, multiline), Optional tags. | • "Experience saved!" toast.  
• Redirect to Navigate Experiences with new card highlighted. | • Validation errors inline (e.g., "Title required").  
• Server error banner; form retains data. |

### 4.3  Navigate Experiences
| Interaction | Behaviour | Failure Handling |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| Experience List | Cards sorted newest-first, colour coded by behavioural theme. | If list empty, placeholder: "No experiences yet." |
| Filter Bubbles | Clicking bubble shows only matching experiences; "All" resets. | If filter yields none, placeholder: "No matches for this theme." |
| Expand Card | Show full content, metadata, created/updated dates, "Edit" & "Delete". | N/A |
| Edit | Opens inline form with prefilled title & story. Diff block appears when editing via suggestion. On save: card collapses, success message shows. | • Save failure keeps form open and shows banner. |
| Delete | Confirmation dialog: "This can't be undone." On confirm, card disappears. | • Delete failure shows banner; card stays. |

### 4.4  Add Question *(minimal for now)*
| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Add question text & category, click "Save". | Question appears in bank; Random Question can surface it. |

## 5. Non-Functional Experience Goals
• **Responsiveness** – Mobile, tablet, desktop layouts tested.  
• **Accessibility** – All controls reachable via keyboard, with aria-labels.  
• **Feedback** – Every user action surfaces either a success toast or descriptive inline error.  
• **Undo Safety** – Risky actions (delete) require confirmation; edits preserve data on error.  
• **Session Continuity** – Returning via deep link (`/navigate-experiences?editId=` etc.) reproduces correct state.
