## Interview-Prep Web App – Comprehensive Testing Plan (v1.0)

### Purpose
Ensure the customer experience documented in *requirements.txt* remains intact as the codebase evolves. The plan follows a **thin-slice, incremental** approach: we write and stabilise one logical group of tests at a time, committing only when the suite is green.

---
### Testing Principles
1. **Customer-centric** – validate behaviour observable by users, not internal implementation.
2. **Fast & deterministic** – tests must run headlessly in CI under <60 s with no external prompts.
3. **Isolated** – each test seeds/tears down its own data; the order of execution is irrelevant.
4. **Single reason to fail** – each describes exactly one expectation.
5. **Living documentation** – this file is updated whenever tests are added/changed.

### Tooling Stack
| Layer              | Library             | Notes |
|--------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Unit / Integration | **Jest**            | Default runner + coverage |
| React UI           | **@testing-library/react** | DOM-oriented assertions |
| API Integration    | **supertest**       | Runs handlers via Next.js test server |
| End-to-End (later) | **Playwright**      | Scriptable, headless E2E; _phase-3_ |
| Fixtures           | **mongodb-memory-server** | Spawns in-memory MongoDB for isolation |
| Coverage           | built-in Istanbul   | Gate ≥ 80 % statements on main modules |

### Phased Roadmap
Each phase corresponds to a distinct area of the product. We will implement **all** tests in Phase-1 before unlocking Phase-2, etc.

| Phase | Area / Feature (from requirements) | Test Types | Status |
|-------|------------------------------------|------------|--------|
| 1     | Navigation Bar                     | Unit / React | ✔ complete |

### Detailed Test Objectives
Below we list concrete test cases per phase. These will be ticked as they are implemented.

#### Phase 1 – Navigation Bar
1. **Navbar renders** on every page with correct title.
2. **Links** highlight the current route.
3. Unknown route → 404 page shows navbar with title.

#### Phase 2 – Answer a Question
4. ✔ Random question loads when button clicked (mock `/api/questions/random`).
5. ✔ Generate button disabled with empty question; enabled otherwise.
6. ✔ Generate Answer shows animated spinner during request.
7. ✔ Successful response renders markdown answer blocks.
8. ✔ Error response shows toast and no answer block.
9. ✔ Reset button clears state and re-enables inputs.

#### Phase 3 – RAG Pipeline (API)
10. ✔ `/api/experiences/generate` returns answer that includes at least one snippet & reference link.
11. ✔ Vector search index param (`index`) is passed in aggregation.
12. ✔ Returns 400 if question missing.

#### Phase 4 – Add Experience Form
13. ✔ Form validation prevents submission of empty title/content.
14. ✔ Successful POST displays success toast and redirects to Navigate page.
15. ✔ Category auto-assignment occurs (mock OpenAI) and is stored.

#### Phase 5 – Navigate Experiences
16. Experiences list fetches from `/api/experiences/list` and renders cards.
17. Category dropdown filters list.
18. Clicking card expands details; second click collapses.
19. Edit button opens pre-filled edit form.
20. Successful save shows success message and re-renders card view-only.
21. Failed save keeps form open and displays error.

#### Phase 6 – Write-in & Evaluation
22. Typing answer then Evaluate calls `/api/experiences/evaluate` and displays feedback markdown.
23. Similarity check calls `/api/experiences/find-similar` and shows prompt when > 0.8.

#### Phase 7 – Practice Out Loud
24. Upload of recorded audio calls `/api/experiences/transcribe` and shows transcription.
25. Error uploading empty file returns helpful error.

#### Phase 8 – Migration Script
26. `scripts/migrate-categories.js --dry-run` outputs proposed updates without writes.
27. `--write` flag updates documents (mocked MongoDB).

#### Phase 9 – End-to-End
28. Full happy path: add experience → answer question → edit mapped experience → see changes in Navigate page.

---
### Implementation Workflow
1. **Create tests for Phase-1** inside `__tests__/phase1_navbar.test.js`.
2. Run `npm test`; ensure suite passes.
3. Mark corresponding objectives as ✔ in this file.
4. Push commit.
5. Repeat for next phase.

### Next Action
We will now implement **Phase-1 Navigation Bar tests**.
