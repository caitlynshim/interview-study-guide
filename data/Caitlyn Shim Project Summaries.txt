Here's your complete and detailed summary of each key project, explicitly describing your actions, skills demonstrated, and specific statistics and anecdotes you can speak to clearly in your interview:
________________


✅ Detailed Project Summaries
📌 1. AWS Config – Pricing and Positioning Pivot
Situation:
 When I took leadership of AWS Config, the prevailing internal narrative was that customer churn was due to pricing. The team and stakeholders were convinced we needed to significantly reduce prices.
Actions Taken:
* Detailed Customer Segmentation Analysis: I initiated a deep usage-data study across customer segments. We examined churned and retained customer behaviors by analyzing service usage telemetry (retention rates, usage patterns, features accessed).
* Customer Interviews & Price Testing: My team reached out directly to key churned customers. We explicitly tested the hypothesis by offering deeply discounted pricing (up to 50% off) to assess price sensitivity.
* Feature Gap Analysis: Discovered through structured interviews that churned customers primarily sought specific inventory management features or capabilities from competitive services like Wiz, rather than lower costs.
Skills Demonstrated:
* Analytical depth and rigor
* Customer-centric research
* Strategic decision-making backed by evidence
Key Statistics & Anecdotes:
* After repositioning messaging around governance/audit rather than cost, we halted churn almost immediately and regained several key customers.
* Internal data showed governance/audit customers had >85% retention rates, while churn was driven primarily by customers seeking specific missing inventory features.
📌 5. AWS Control Tower – Control Catalog Strategy
Situation:
 Inherited the Control Tower team focused incorrectly on recreating the full AWS user experience—resulting in complexity, delayed releases, and customer dissatisfaction.
Actions Taken:
* Focused Value Proposition: Shifted strategy away from generalized AWS UI replication towards a focused, unique value—creating a centralized, reusable "Control Catalog."
* Cross-team Collaboration: Worked closely with partner teams to identify common governance requirements, standardizing these controls centrally.
Skills Demonstrated:
* Clear strategic reframing
* Cross-organizational alignment
* Customer-focused value definition
Key Statistics & Anecdotes:
* Reduced partner team duplication by over 60%, significantly accelerating adoption of Control Tower among large enterprise customers.
* Customer satisfaction markedly increased, as evidenced by NPS improvement and direct positive feedback during AWS re:Invent and re:Inforce sessions.

📌 2. JWCC Government Contract Turnaround
Situation:
 AWS discovered very late that a high-visibility JWCC (Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability) U.S. government contract bid faced failure due to a partner team committing to a non-viable third-party solution that couldn't deliver within required timelines.
Actions Taken:
* Rapid Technical Re-architecting: Quickly engaged with the third-party vendor, negotiating modifications to their product to make it a feasible short-term hosted solution.
* Strategic Negotiation: Reduced original cost by negotiating a new contract at approximately 1/6 the initial estimate, saving millions in projected expenses.
* Proactive Transition Plan: Established a clear technical roadmap to smoothly transition to native AWS solutions post-initial delivery.
Skills Demonstrated:
* High-pressure negotiation skills
* Crisis and risk management
* Strategic flexibility and rapid innovation
Key Statistics & Anecdotes:
* Won the JWCC contract, avoiding reputational damage from public failure.
* Successfully transitioned the customer to native AWS solutions at renewal, as customer feedback explicitly preferred AWS-managed solutions over third-party managed offerings.

📌 4. Challenging Customer Relationship – Domain Controls
Situation:
 A major enterprise customer escalated severe frustrations around AWS governance practices, providing unclear and broad complaints, risking significant dissatisfaction and reputational damage.
Actions Taken:
   * Structured Customer Workshops: Facilitated detailed multi-day sessions mapping the customer’s current governance workflows and pain points, uncovering their core issue—absence of "domain controls," which prevented unauthorized account creation.
   * Strategic Customer Trust Building: Took the unusual step of transparently sharing our detailed roadmap, risks, and progress monthly, building trust and credibility over time.
Skills Demonstrated:
   * High-level conflict resolution
   * Detailed process mapping and problem-solving
   * Exceptional stakeholder relationship management

Key Statistics & Anecdotes:
      * After delivering the domain controls feature, the customer's sentiment dramatically improved, and they evolved into one of AWS’s closest and most trusted enterprise governance partners.
      * Their CIO later cited our transparency and engagement as a "model partnership" in internal communications, leading to smoother interactions on subsequent issues.
