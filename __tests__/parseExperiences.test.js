________________

ðŸ“Œ 1. AWS Config â€“ Pricing and Positioning Pivot
Situation:
When I took leadership of AWS Config, the prevailing internal narrative was that customer churn was due to pricing.

Actions Taken:
* Detailed Customer Segmentation Analysis: I initiated a deep usage-data study
* Customer Interviews & Price Testing: My team reached out directly to key churned customers

Skills Demonstrated:
* Analytical depth and rigor
* Customer-centric research
* Strategic decision-making backed by evidence

Key Statistics & Anecdotes:
* After repositioning messaging around governance/audit rather than cost, we halted churn almost immediately
________________

ðŸ“Œ 2. JWCC Government Contract Turnaround
Situation:
AWS discovered very late that a high-visibility JWCC contract bid faced failure.

Actions Taken:
* Rapid Technical Re-architecting: Quickly engaged with the third-party vendor
* Strategic Negotiation: Reduced original cost by negotiating a new contract

Skills Demonstrated:
* High-pressure negotiation skills
* Crisis and risk management

Key Statistics & Anecdotes:
* Won the JWCC contract, avoiding reputational damage from public failure
